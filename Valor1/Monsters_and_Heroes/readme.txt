To do this code, I built the following objects(classes):
Armor/Weapon/Potion/Spell: The objects of items
Four Bags of the objects above: Objects to contain those items on a hero
Four Market Cells of the objects above: Objects of Markets selling the items
Board: The game board objects, which contains the cells
Cell: Each grid on the board. It has different kinds (extended by more detailed cells)
Dice: Object to decide whether a heroparty meets monsters
Fight: The class used for the process of fighting
FightEnd: Check whether a fight ends (all heroes or monsters die)
Hero: A single hero
HeroParty: The party of heroes
HeroFactory: Create the heroes
Inventory: An object of hero which contains the four kinds of items
MHGame: object controlling game process
Monster: A single monster
MonsterParty: The party of monsters
MonsterFactory: Create the monsters
Normal Cell: The common cells, where battle can occur
Rule: Some simple calculation rules about the game.

The rest objects are the different kinds of heroes/monsters/items objects.

Thank you!
